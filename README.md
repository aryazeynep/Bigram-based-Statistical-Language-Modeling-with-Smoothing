# Bigram-based-Statistical-Language-Modeling-with-Smoothing
Implemented a Bigram Language Model from scratch using Python. The program supports unsmoothed and add-one smoothed probabilities for both unigrams and bigrams. It can calculate sentence probabilities and generate sentences using probabilistic bigram sampling.
